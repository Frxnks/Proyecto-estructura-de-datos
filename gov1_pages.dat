remember CHHS encourages practical and feasible energy saving measures while considering the health and safety of clients workers and family members Welcome to Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board The MRMIB was created in 1990 with a broad mandate to advise the Governor and the Legislature on strategies for reducing the number of uninsured persons in the state The Board is comprised of volunteer members appointed by the Governor and the Legislature Members serve four year terms The MRMIB is dedicated to improving the health of Californians by increasing access to affordable comprehensive quality health care coverage The MRMIB meets in public session usually on the fourth Wednesday of each month The MRMIB administers three health care programs They are The Access for Infants and Mothers AIM program provides low cost health insurance coverage to uninsured low income pregnant women and their infants AIM is part of California s efforts to increase health coverage of pregnant women and their infants The average subscriber is a married woman living in a household with a family income between 200 300 of the federal poverty level A pregnant woman and her infant s enrolled in AIM receive their care from one of nine health plans participating in the program The pregnant woman participates in the cost of her health care services through a low cost subscriber contribution The State of California supplements the subscriber contribution to cover the full cost of care AIM is funded from tobacco tax funds For an application Call toll free 1 800 433 2611 The Healthy Families Program HFP provides low cost health dental and vision coverage to uninsured children in low wage families Families participating in the program choose their health dental and vision plan Families pay premiums of 4 9 per child per month maximum of 27 per family to participate in the program The State and Federal government provide funding to the HFP For an application call toll free 1 888 747 1222 The Major Risk Medical Insurance Program MRMIP provides health insurance for Californians who are unable to obtain coverage in the individual health insurance market The majority of subscribers are between the ages of 40 64 and 58 are women People enroll in the program because they have been rejected for coverage by an insurance carrier or health plan due to a pre existing condition After 36 consecutive months in the program subscribers are required to leave MRMIP but they leave with a guarantee of coverage from plans selling coverage in the individual insurance market Services in the program are delivered through contracts with health insurance plans Californians qualifying for the program and for the guaranteed issue coverage that follows MRMIP coverage participate in the cost of their coverage by paying premiums The State of California supplements those premiums to cover the cost of care in MRMIP The State shares the cost of post MRMIP coverage with health plans that provide the coverage MRMIP s subsidy is funded from tobacco tax funds For an application call toll free 1 800 289 6574 The County Children s Health Initiative Program C CHIP provides low cost health coverage to uninsured children through age 19 not eligible for HFP or Medi Cal up to 300 of the Federal Income Guidelines When approved by CMS the program will allow counties and other entities to use local funds as a match to draw down unused federal State Children s Health Insurance Program SCHIP funds The counties will use these funds to provide health insurance to additional children using their locally sponsored health plans The program is managed by MRMIB and administered the county C CHIP provides benefits similar to HFP but serves children between 250 percent and 300 percent of the federal poverty level FPL Four pilot counties have implemented C CHIP and are waiting federal approval and another four counties are in the planning stages of their program This program is considered to be innovative in its manner of funding Usually federal funds require a State fund match before funds can be drawn down The C CHIP program when approved will allow counties to match available federal funds originally allocated to California but for which there was no State appropriated match These available federal funds along with county matched funds will provide needed services for children For further information call Janette Lopez at 916 327 6237 Pacific Health Advantage The Health Insurance Plan of California In addition to the above three programs the Board established in 1993 the State of California s Health Insurance Plan of California The HIPC The HIPC is the nation s pre eminent small employer purchasing pool The HIPC was successfully managed by the Board until

securely have never been greater Organizations having invested precious resources and scarce skills in various necessary security efforts such as risk analysis certification accreditation security architectures policy development and other security efforts can be tempted to neglect or insufficiently develop a comprehensive and systematic operational security testing program This guide stresses the need for an effective security testing program within federal agencies Testing serves several purposes One no matter how well a given system may have been developed the nature of today s complex systems with large volumes of code complex internal interactions interoperability with external components unknown interdependencies coupled with vendor cost and schedule pressures means that exploitable flaws will always be present and will surface over time Accordingly security testing must fill the gap between the state of system development as it is and actual operation of these systems Two security testing is important for understanding calibrating and documenting the operational Continued at ITL Bulletins page amp see complete list of all Computer Security ITL Bulletins

Co Chairs Susan Molinari and Richard Ravitch To obtain a copy of the report follow the instructions provided at the bottom of this page We have been honored to lead the Millennial Housing Commission during the past 17 months as we performed a thorough re examination of the federal role in meeting the nation 8217 s housing challenges at Congress 8217 request The 22 commissioners appointed to this task were drawn from across the country and from across the spectrum of housing ideologies and experience We are particularly pleased therefore to have achieved concurrence among all but one of the appointed members Click here to obtain a copy of the 8220 Dissenting Statement to the Report of the Millennial Housing Commission 8221 by Commissioner Robert Rector The Commission included former elected officials participants on previous national commissions housing researchers builders managers and owners planners and public administrators and leaders of community development organizations Our findings and recommendations obviously reflect the great diversity of philosophy and experience represented but on one thing we all agree 8212 we unequivocally care about housing and some fundamental precepts First housing matters It represents the single largest expenditure for most American families and the single largest source of wealth for most homeowners The development of housing has a major impact on the national economy and the economic growth and health of regions and communities Housing is inextricably linked to access to jobs and healthy communities and the social behavior of the families who occupy it The failure to achieve adequate housing leads to significant societal costs Second there is simply not enough affordable housing The inadequacy of supply increases dramatically as one moves down the ladder of family earnings The challenge is most acute for rental housing in high cost areas and the most egregious problem is for the very poor We recognize that our country is engaged in a war that affects our vital interests and that we have experienced a serious economic downturn from which we are entering a tentative recovery There is a serious public debate as to which tax and spending policies will best support the sound fiscal management that our nation requires Even within this context resources for affordable housing provide important economic social and societal benefits The inexorable growth in the numbers of families of those working in service sectors and of immigrants seeking to take part in the American Dream 8212 coupled with community opposition to high density development the gentrification or abandonment and deterioration of an increasing percentage of our housing stock and the growing affordability gap between haves and have nots 8212 require that the Government of the United States seriously address the question of how our society can produce and preserve more housing for more American families in a more rational thoughtful and efficient way in the decade ahead As affordable housing production is increased within the context of healthy inclusive communities the economy is strengthened more

environments nbsp In 2002 USTDA acted quickly to respond to infrastructure priorities and needs within Afghanistan and the other frontline states nbsp In these and other developing and middle income countries around the world USTDA strives to provide specific tailored and results oriented responses designed to lead to greater stability through capacity building commercial development and increased employment As a core priority USTDA facilitates development in emerging markets by promoting U S partnerships in high priority overseas projects nbsp Last year the cumulative dollar value of export sales associated with USTDA supported projects topped 19 billion although that number only tells part of the story nbsp Less directly quantifiable but no less important are the agency s advances in overseas development efforts This year also marks USTDA s first full year in our new headquarters nbsp Located just one half block from our old location the new office provides much needed additional space nbsp It also allows us to better serve U S businesses and foreign delegates on visits to the Washington D C area through our enlarged and improved Business Center and expanded USTDA

Zensheu Chang Opening Postdoc positions Dr Shyh Shiuh Lih Dr Stewart Sherrit The NDEAA lab is involved with a broad range of R D topics as described in the following clickable icons The developed mechanisms are driven by elastic waves mechanical vibrations and or electroactive materials Examples of these mechanisms include ultrasonic and surface acoustic wave motors and piezoelectric pumps that are driven by traveling flexural waves Recently an ultrasonic sonic driller corer USDC was developed and shown to have enormous potential for sampling deep drilling probing sensing and in situ analysis making it a Lab on a Drill In parallel electroactive polymers are being investigated for use as actuators artificial muscles Other technologies that are being explored include Haptic interfaces for robotics and Human Muscle Enhancers high power ultrasound for medical treatment ferroelectric source that generates various radiations and charged particles biomimetic technologies and geophysical probing using elastic waves In addition to planetary applications these devices and mechanisms have potential terrestrial applications for medical commercial and others These efforts involve technical cooperation with scientists and engineers at various universities research institutes medical centers and industry in the USA and internationally This lab has been the subject of

http|| natt|| pnl|| gov|| NATT Home Page Home Conferences Technologies Newsletters Related nbsp Sites nbsp The Northwest Alliance for Transportation Technologies NATT is a partnership working to address national technological challenges by focusing relevant industrial and research capabilities on specific transportation goals This partnership combines the strengths of national laboratories research universities the Boeing Company lightweight metal power to manufacturers with abundant low cost help meet its objectives The Alliance provides a format for these diverse innovative noncompetitive entities to develop solutions for a variety of projects NATT activities are co funded by the industrial participants and the U S Department of Energy s Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies The initial mission is to assist the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles PNGV a Presidential initiative in achieving its goals Our Mission PNGV PARTNERSHIP In 1993 the U S government teamed with the three major domestic automakers Chrysler Ford and General Motors in a partnership to develop technologies necessary to create the motor vehicle of the future The partnership aims to strengthen U S competitiveness by producing a mid sized vehicle with performance and price similar to today s cars but with triple the fuel efficiency greatly reduced emissions and 80 percent recyclability A key to achieving PNGV goals is to reduce the weight of the vehicle by 50 percent Weight reduction will be achieved primarily by using lightweight materials to replace current steel components A lighter vehicle will also enable use of more efficient propulsion systems PNGV faces several obstacles including a lack of low cost lightweight materials and effective manufacturing and joining technologies for these materials Once these obstacles are overcome PNGV will be better positioned to deliver significant environmental energy and economic benefits to the United States Fuel efficient vehicles will lessen our reliance on foreign oil supplies especially as our population continues to grow and more people use motor vehicle transportation Further the U S automobile manufacturing industry is integral to the nation s economy accounting for one in seven U S jobs Technological improvements of this kind will help position U S industry for world leadership WHAT IS NATT NATT is a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL initiative comprised of multiple regional industrial sectors brought together to improve U S industrial technologies Partners will focus on the research and formulation of advanced cost effective lightweight materials advanced manufacturing processes and prototype or pilot scale development The proposed NATT partnership will include the Boeing Company Northwest lightweight aluminum magnesium and titanium producers other automotive and aerospace suppliers regional electric suppliers such as the Bonneville Power Administration state universities the Big Three auto manufacturers and national laboratories WHY NATT The U S DOE Office of Transportation Technologies has recognized a unique opportunity to ally these Pacific Northwest components to address serious technological challenges Using cost shared government funds these noncompetitive entities can more efficiently work together toward a goal that benefits everyone OBJECTIVES NATT s principal focus is the development of technologies necessary to achieve the 50 percent weight reduction required to meet PNGV s objectives NATT partners will use their resources to design new lightweight metals shaping and connecting techniques and to lower material costs NATT will also work with the domestic transportation industry aerospace vehicular suppliers etc to develop technical tools required to enhance U S competitiveness and benefit a broad range of noncompetitive industrial sectors NATT will be a strategic U S asset addressing the multi disciplinary research and development that traditionally falls between fundamental university research and near term profit oriented industrial research Results of this work will ensure that the U S is a strong player in the world market UNIQUE POSITIONING The Pacific Northwest is well positioned through NATT to contribute to the national vehicle program PNGV The region s attributes include 40 percent of domestic aluminum production future cars will contain 50 percent more aluminum than today s cars Boeing the largest manufacturer of lightweight structures PNNL a broad based national laboratory having significant experience with the auto industry lightweight metals industry and Boeing Large low cost power providers State universities Magnesium and titanium production plants SUMMARY The Northwest Alliance for Transportation Technologies brings together Pacific Northwest entities to meet the considerable challenges facing PNGV The success of NATT s work will be important to the future of our national economy our environment and the Pacific Northwest region Powerpoint Presentation To view a Powerpoint presentation that will provide an overview of the NATT initiative click here nbsp This may take a
